# Personal Website
View my website [here](https://maahma.github.io/maahma-portfolio/)

I built this site using Next.js and CSS. The posts are written in Markdown and rendered dynamically using the Next.js markdown-to-jsx library, which converts Markdown content into JSX

This website showcases my projects and blog posts on various topics, including my learning journey, career, and hobbies (coming soon...)
