# Talking Social Robot

Have you ever imagined studying with a robot that can talk to you, understand your emotions, and even help you plan your schedule? That‚Äôs exactly what my dissertation project aimed to achieve!

Using a **MERN stack application**, the **Furhat social robot**, and **FaceReader software**, I created a system that helps students manage their study schedules and stay on top of their academic goals‚Äîall while promoting emotional well-being. 

Before I dive into the specifics, see the project in action:

## **The Core Components**
The project consisted of 3 main components :

### **1. MERN Application**
I chose MERN stack for the application for its popularity and extensive community support, which provided helpful tutorials during development. The MERN stack consists of the following four technologies:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage application data.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building the front-end user interface.
- **Express**: A back-end framework that connects the front end with the database and handles HTTP requests.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that serves as the server, enabling efficient handling of multiple asynchronous operations.

This full-stack web app forms the backbone of the system, and provides an interface for students to:
- Add their class schedules
- Track assignment deadlines
- Generate study plans and quizzes

### **2. Furhat Robot**
Furhat is a social robot designed to engage with users using lifelike facial gestures and speech. In this project, it acted as a study buddy by:
- **Quizzing Students**: Reinforcing learning by asking questions based on their notes.
- **Calming Exercises**: Performing activities such as:
    - **Guided Breathing**: Helping students focus and reduce stress.
    - **Gratitude Reflections**: Encouraging students to share something they were grateful for.
    - **Emotion Regulation**: Providing a platform for students to express concerns and feel heard.

### **3. FaceReader Software**
Developed by Noldus, FaceReader detects and analyzes the six universal expressions: happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, and disgusted, plus contempt and a neutral state. In this project, it played a crucial role by:
- Detecting signs of stress, such as sadness, anger, or fear.
- Alerting Furhat to initiate calming exercises to help students relax.

## Interaction between Components
At high level the components interacted in the following way:

**Furhat Robot**  
The Furhat Robot received requests from the MERN application. These requests dictated actions such as:

- Greeting the user.
- Introducing the user to the application's functionalities.
- Quizzing the user whenever a quiz was generated.
- Initiating a calming activity if the user appeared stressed.

**MERN Application and FaceReader Software**

When the user started a study session, the MERN application notified the FaceReader software to begin analyzing the user's emotions. If FaceReader detected a stress-related emotion, it sent a response back to the MERN application. The MERN application then relayed a request to Furhat to initiate an appropriate calming activity, helping the user relax.

## **The Power of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT**
To add intelligence to the system, I integrated OpenAI‚Äôs Large Language Model (LLM). Here‚Äôs how they were used:
- **Study Schedules:** Using the Chat Completions API, personalized study plans were generated based on users‚Äô class schedules and deadlines. These plans outlined specific tasks for each study session.
- **Quizzes:** Quizzes were generated from user-submitted notes, which Furhat used to quiz students interactively.
- **Furhat‚Äôs Conversations:** LLM powered the robot‚Äôs responses during calming activities, enabling it to engage empathetically and naturally.

### **Prompt Engineering: Making It Work**
Getting the best results from OpenAI required carefully crafted prompts. This process, known as **prompt engineering**, ensured that the outputs were accurate and useful. Key strategies included:
- Writing clear and specific instructions
- Breaking complex tasks into smaller steps
- Testing and refining prompts systematically

For generating a study schedule, I designed the prompt(shown below) to include all the necessary details, such as the start and end times, tasks for each session, and the desired format for the output. This ensured I could easily extract relevant details and display them on the user interface.

## **Why This Project Matters**
Have you ever wondered why it‚Äôs so hard to remember what you studied just a few days ago? German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus was curious about this too, which led him to uncover the _Forgetting Curve_.
![Hermann Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve](/post-imgs/forgetting-curve.png)

This curve explains how memory fades over time‚Äîand, more importantly, how to stop it. His research showed that reviewing information at just the right moments, before it‚Äôs forgotten completely, can dramatically improve memory retention. This approach, known as _spaced learning_ or _distributed practice_, is a proven way to study smarter, not harder.

But there‚Äôs more. Research over the years has highlighted another key to learning: the _testing effect_. Actively quizzing yourself‚Äîrather than passively reviewing notes‚Äîstrengthens memory and helps transfer information from short-term to long-term storage. Combine that with spaced repetition, and you‚Äôve got a powerhouse strategy for mastering just about anything.

However, academic success isn‚Äôt just about cognitive techniques. It‚Äôs also about mental well-being. Studies show that students who feel emotionally supported and optimistic are more engaged and perform better academically. This balance between effective study strategies and emotional health is crucial‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what this project aimed to address.

This application combines education and well-being, demonstrating how technology can support students in unique ways. By integrating advanced tools like Furhat, FaceReader, and OpenAI, I explored innovative ways to:
- Make studying less stressful
- Foster emotional health
- Enhance the overall learning experience
