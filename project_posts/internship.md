# Machine Learning Internship
For the past 1.5 months, I've been working as an intern under Dr Chaona Chen, lecturer in Robotics, and Dr Junhong Yang, Senior lecturer in Finance, at the University of Sheffield, on a cross department project to analyze the emotional states of company managers during conference calls

The objectives of the internship:
- Companies frequently hold conference calls with investors and analysts to discuss their performance and future outlook
- These calls often include a Q&A session where analysts ask clarifying or scrutinizing questions from managers
- Investors analyze executives' tones and cues for signals about potential profits and stock trends
- This research project investigates the emotional states of managers using audio and transcript data from these calls.
- The insights gained could support investment decisions and complement quantitative data, such as financial reports.
