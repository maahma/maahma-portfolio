# Preparing for coding interviews 

<!-- [![Github](../images/github.svg)](https://github.com/maahma/Python-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms "view code") -->

The best way to practice for coding interviews is by solving **LeetCode** questions. While there are other platforms like **HackerRank** and **GeeksforGeeks** that offer similar problem sets, **LeetCode is by far the most popular and widely used** for interview preparation.

## How I'm Starting My LeetCode Journey
I was initially confused about how to approach LeetCode. Should I take a **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** course first, or should I start solving questions topic by topic? While I had sufficient DSA knowledge from my bachelor's degree, I needed a refresher. After some research, I realized that **actively solving problems** was the most effective way to regain and strengthen my understanding.

## LeetCoding Strategy
After scouring **Reddit** (yes, it does have useful content), I curated a structured approach to LeetCode:
- **Mix different topics** instead of spending a whole week on arrays and another on linked lists.
- **Weekends for theory, weekdays for implementation** ‚Äì study proofs, patterns, and concepts on weekends and apply them during the week.
- **Track progress** by recording solved questions per week in a GitHub repository.
- **Set a goal** ‚Äì for example, finishing all core topics in 7 weeks. After that, keep solving Top 100 Problems on Leetcode.
- **Focus on understanding, not just solving** ‚Äì learn to **explain** solutions as if in an interview.
- **Tackle more easy questions from difficult topics** before moving on to harder ones.
- **Do one mock interview per week** to simulate real interview pressure.
- **Use a timer for each question:**
    - **Easy** ‚Äì 10 minutes
    - **Medium** ‚Äì 25 minutes
    - **Hard** ‚Äì 45 minutes
- **If stuck,** check the discussion board for hints but **don‚Äôt look at the full solution immediately.** Restart the timer and try again. If still stuck, review the solution, take notes, and mark it for revision.

## Daily LeetCode Plan (4-5 Hours Per Day)
To maximize efficiency, I structured my daily LeetCode practice as follows:
- **Easy questions** ‚Äì 4 per day
- **Medium questions** ‚Äì 3-4 per day
- **Hard questions** ‚Äì 2-3 per day

If I'm going to do a difficult topic like Dynamic Programming, then I'll only focus on easy and medium questions.

I'm following the study routine mentioned [here](https://github.com/ramirorichmand/RR10_MyStudyPlan?tab=readme-ov-file#background-). This 16-week (4-month) routine aligns perfectly with my goals and will allow me to solve 100+ LeetCode questions, improving both my interview preparation and general problem-solving skills.

I'm using the learning resources listed [here](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/tree/main). My plan is to study theoretical concepts on weekends and dedicate weekdays to solving practice questions.
